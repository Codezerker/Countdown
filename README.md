# Countdown

A friendly disk usage counter for macOS

![](./Screenshots/sample-screenshot.png)

## Why Countdown

Sometimes our Macs just went out of disk space, and we don't know why.

Sometimes after a restart, the problem went away, but a few days later, it comes again.

Finding out which files are occupying our disk space is obscure and time-consuming, thus we hope this tool will help you a bit on that task.

## System Requirements

- Tested on macOS 10.13
- Should work on macOS 10.10 and later
